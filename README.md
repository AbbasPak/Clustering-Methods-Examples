# Clustering-Methods-Examples

`Clustering` is a fundamental technique in unsupervised machine learning that involves grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). The goal is to uncover the inherent structure in data without using pre-labeled responses.

#### Applications of Clustering:

+ Customer Segmentation: Identifying distinct groups of customers based on purchasing behavior.
+ Image Segmentation: Dividing an image into segments for analysis.
+ Anomaly Detection: Identifying unusual data points in a dataset.
+ Biological Data Analysis: Grouping genes or proteins with similar expression patterns.

This repository aims to provide an [overview of various clustering methods](https://github.com/AbbasPak/Clustering-Methods-Examples/blob/main/Clustering%20methods.md), along with practical examples and implementations.
